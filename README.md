https://jackhance.com/anti-emoji-converter/

### What is this?

This is a tool to add a anti symbol to any emoji (or really any text). It works
on *most* devices but it has decently random effectiveness, it tends to work a little *too well* on iphones. 

### How does it work?

All it really does is append a character with code `8416` (more info [here](http://www.codetable.net/hex/20e0)) to the given string, which then spits out something looking simiar to

🐴⃠  👮🏻⃠   ️‍🏳️⃠  🥧⃠  🍆⃠

(this might look good in your browser and it might not :shrug:).
